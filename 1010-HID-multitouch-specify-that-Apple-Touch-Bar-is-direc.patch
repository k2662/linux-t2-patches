Subject: [PATCH 4/5] HID: multitouch: specify that Apple Touch Bar is direct

Currently the driver determines the device type based on the
application, but this value is not reliable on Apple Touch Bar, where
the application is HID_DG_TOUCHPAD even though this device is direct,
so add a quirk for the same.
